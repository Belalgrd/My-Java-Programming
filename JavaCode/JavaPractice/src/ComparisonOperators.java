/*
Comparison Operators
Comparison operators in Java are used to compare two values and return a boolean result. They are commonly used in control flow statements like if, while, and for loops.

Here are the main comparison operators:

== (equal to): Checks if two values are equal.

Example: a == b (true if a is equal to b).
!= (not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.

Example: a != b (true if a is not equal to b).
> (greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

Example: a > b (true if a is greater than b).
< (less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

Example: a < b (true if a is less than b).
>= (greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Example: a >= b (true if a is greater than or equal to b).
<= (less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

Example: a <= b (true if a is less than or equal to b).
